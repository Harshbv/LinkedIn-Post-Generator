    "text": "The Biggest Scam - Ghost Hiring.\n\nWelcome to the frustrating world of ghost hiring, where companies post positions they never intend to fill.\n\nGhost hiring is the latest trick in the corporate world, and it\u2019s deeply frustrating for jobseekers.\n\nImagine going through the application process, submitting your resume, attending interviews, and then\u2014*silence.*\n\nYou\u2019re left wondering what happened. No rejection, no updates, just pure silence.\n\nThis is ghost hiring.\n\nCompanies sometimes open up positions not because they truly need to hire but to:\n\n1. *Build a talent pool* \u2013 They want to have resumes ready for when the time comes to actually hire.\n\n2. *Look busy* \u2013 Some companies want to show their investors or higher-ups that they are constantly expanding, even if they have no real intention of hiring.\n\n3. *Competitive analysis* \u2013 Believe it or not, companies will interview candidates from competitors just to gather insights.\n\n4. *Budget justification* -Some teams open positions to secure budget approvals, but once the budget is allocated, they may delay or cancel the hiring process.\n\n5. *Internal candidates* - Sometimes positions are posted externally to meet legal or company requirements, but there\u2019s already an internal candidate selected for the role.\n\nThis practice leaves jobseekers in limbo, crushed and confused, with false hope that they might still get a call.\n\nIt\u2019s emotionally draining, leading to unnecessary anxiety and stress.\n\nTo everyone who has been ghosted by companies, remember that this doesn\u2019t reflect your value.\n\nThe system is broken, not you. Keep going\u2014you will find the right opportunity that respects your time and effort.",
