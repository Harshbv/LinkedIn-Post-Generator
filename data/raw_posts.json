  "text": "The Biggest Scam - Ghost Hiring.\n\nWelcome to the frustrating world of ghost hiring, where companies post positions they never intend to fill.\n\nGhost hiring is the latest trick in the corporate world, and it’s deeply frustrating for jobseekers.\n\nImagine going through the application process, submitting your resume, attending interviews, and then—*silence.*\n\nYou’re left wondering what happened. No rejection, no updates, just pure silence.\n\nThis is ghost hiring.\n\nCompanies sometimes open up positions not because they truly need to hire but to:\n\n1. *Build a talent pool* – They want to have resumes ready for when the time comes to actually hire.\n\n2. *Look busy* – Some companies want to show their investors or higher-ups that they are constantly expanding, even if they have no real intention of hiring.\n\n3. *Competitive analysis* – Believe it or not, companies will interview candidates from competitors just to gather insights.\n\n4. *Budget justification* -Some teams open positions to secure budget approvals, but once the budget is allocated, they may delay or cancel the hiring process.\n\n5. *Internal candidates* - Sometimes positions are posted externally to meet legal or company requirements, but there’s already an internal candidate selected for the role.\n\nThis practice leaves jobseekers in limbo, crushed and confused, with false hope that they might still get a call.\n\nIt’s emotionally draining, leading to unnecessary anxiety and stress.\n\nTo everyone who has been ghosted by companies, remember that this doesn’t reflect your value.\n\nThe system is broken, not you. Keep going—you will find the right opportunity that respects your time and effort.",

It’s pricing strategy.\n\nWith IndiGo flights getting cancelled across sectors, thousands of passengers are stranded, panicking, and scrambling for alternatives.\nAnd what did the other airlines do?\n\nQuietly increase fares.\nNot by ₹500… but by ₹5,000–₹10,000+ in some routes.\n\nLook at Delhi → Mumbai today:\n\nThe same flights that were ₹5k–₹6k last week are suddenly ₹24k–₹25k+.\nNo festival.\nNo surge in fuel cost.\nJust people in trouble - and a perfect opportunity to profit.\n\nI know business is business.\nBut sometimes, basic humanity > revenue targets.\n\nImagine families trying to get home.\nStudents.\nPeople travelling for medical emergencies.\nOr someone who simply cannot afford a last-minute 2x fare overnight.\n\nIn moments like these, industries show what they’re truly made of.\n\nA little empathy won’t kill the quarterly numbers.\nBut it might restore faith in the system.\n\nWe need pricing regulations during crises.\nWe need accountability.\nWe need humanity.\n\nBecause when airlines turn a crisis into a revenue opportunity…\nit’s not 'dynamic pricing'.\nIt’s just disappointing.",
